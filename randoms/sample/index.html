			<b>What is this!?</b>
			<br>
			This is a sample page of a basic template for a website. Since I cannot be bothered to make something up to fill in gaps, I just copied an old English assignment! Enjoy. By the way, it's about criminal activity in Detroit.

			<br>
			Detroit is a city of around 700,000 inhabitants and is located in the north western corner of the United States. It is the largest settlement in the state of Michigan and the 18th largest in the country. In 2010, the city was home to around 580,000 African-Americans, (commonly referred to as 'black people'), that is an astonishing 84.3% of the population!  Detroit is the city with the most African-American citizens in the US.
		</p>
		<p id="sectionParagraph">
			The population of the city is decreasing, and so is the crime rate. But the criminal activity in the city is still a major problem. In a survey conducted by the FBI in 2011, it was found that per 100,000 citizens, there were 8280 crimes reported. So in that year there were almost 60,000 crimes reported. Among these crimes were 60 instances of rape, 2,300 of theft and 1,300 occurrences of physical assault, all per 100,000 people. In 2013, there were 333 murders in the city.
				<br>
				<br>
			These rates are considerably huge when stacked up against other US cities. The total of violent crimes reported in Detroit is triple, if not 4 times larger than most other cities like it. Property crime is also a stand out among other cities. The amount of murders in the city is around 10 times more than others. In 2014, the FBI rated Detroit as the third most dangerous city in the country, only behind Flint, also in Michigan and Camden, New Jersey. All these cities have a population majorly compiled of blacks.
				<br>
				<br>
			In the US, it is not a rarity to come across ghettos. A ghetto is an area of a city, usually a slum, which is mostly populated by people of the same ethnicity or race. In Detroit there is what is referred to as 'black ghettos'.  These include suburbs like Brightmoor, Osborn and Greenfield. Evidently, these suburbs also have the highest crime rates in the city.

			Running a business in Detroit can be a difficult and gutsy task. Les Gold and his two children, Seth and Ashley run a pawn shop in downtown Detroit on 8 Mile Road. 'Hardcore Pawn' is a reality TV show that is aired in many countries and it shows the day to day happenings at American Jewellery and Loan.

			That was just one of the customers at the store; hundreds of customers are much the same.
				<br>
				<br>
			In 2013, a family who brought a kids meal from a Detroit Burger King restaurant found a marijuana pipe in the box. The pipe was found by the parents before the child was given the meal and the police were called. The young African-American employee was arrested. Other black fast food workers threatened to spit in the meals of white people as a result of this incident.
				<br>
				<br>
			Detroit is a very dangerous city and it can be expected that one who lives there will be involved in a crime at some stage. It is advisable to not be living there unless you are a swagalicious gangsta. For optimal swagger, see my guide on 'How to gain swag'.
