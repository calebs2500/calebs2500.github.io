				<p>In 1788, eleven British ships landed at Botany Bay, near modern day Sydney. They carried over 1000 Europeans, most of which were convicted criminals. They had set out to create the first colony in Australia.</p>
				
				<br>
				<p>The fleet was under command from from Captain Arthur Phillip, of Britain. The British government had official policies in place; he was under instruction to make peaceful contact with any natives that might cross the fleets path and he ordered as so, but it was not to be.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It was not long before tension was created between colonisers and Aboriginals. The locals saw this as an invasion, and in reprisal, there was conflict. It was not uncommon for white people to spark the conflict either. Conflict for land was happening, and as the land obviously did not already belong to the Europeans but rather the indigenous, it was mostly a one way battle.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p style="color: #b0a9a2;"><a style="color: #004c4c; font-weight: 700;">>>Imagine</a><br>Imagine seeing people that you didn't even know existed, almost alien to you approaching your home. You don't know why, but there they are, just coming towards your house. As they get close, they move themselves into your house; all of a sudden, they're living with you, just like that. No questions asked, just here to take a place in your own home. You have no means of effective communication, and still you have no idea of why, you're only faced with the current situation and no further information. How are you to react to these new people living on your property? That's what t would have been like for the Aboriginals of Botany Bay when the First Fleet arrived.</p>
				<br>
				<p id="sectionHeader">
				So, why was it that the European settlers were taking control of land that very obviously did not belong to them?</p>
				<p>Europeans had developed laws about land ownership, and they were expecting the same from the Aboriginals that they encountered. Supposedly, the European governing figures attempted to find leaders in the Aboriginal community to sign treaties on the behalf of the natives, but could not find an indigenous citizen with the authority to sign such documents. The Europeans weren't expecting this, and didn't have any official laws in place that were also agreed upon by the Aboriginals.</p>
				<br>
				<p>So, there were no agreements made between the two ethnic groups. Even if they could overcome the language barrier, there would be little concepts to agree upon:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The Indigenous did not ever own land, instead they were part of the land</li>
					<li>They did not share a common interest in the uses of the land, other than living on it</li>
				</ul>
