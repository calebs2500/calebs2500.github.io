				<p>In 1788, eleven British ships landed at Botany Bay, near modern day Sydney. They carried over 1000 Europeans, most of which were convicted criminals. They had set out to create the first colony in Australia.</p>
				
				<br>
				<p>The fleet was under command from Captain Arthur Phillip, of Britain. The British government had official policies in place; he was under instruction to make peaceful contact with any natives that might cross the fleets path and he ordered as so, but it was not to be.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It was not long before tension was created between colonisers and Aboriginals. The locals saw this as an invasion, and in reprisal, there was conflict. It was not uncommon for white people to spark the conflict either. Conflict for land was happening, and as the land obviously did not already belong to the Europeans but rather the indigenous, it was mostly a one way battle.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p style="color: #b0a9a2;"><a style="color: #004c4c; font-weight: 700;">>>Imagine</a><br>Imagine seeing people that you didn't even know existed, almost alien to you approaching your home. You don't know why, but there they are, just coming towards your house. As they get close, they move themselves into your house; all of a sudden, they're living with you, just like that. No questions asked, just here to take a place in your own home. You have no means of effective communication, and still you have no idea of why, you're only faced with the current situation and no further information. How are you to react to these new people living on your property? That's what it would have been like for the Aboriginals of Botany Bay when the First Fleet arrived.</p>
				<br>
				<p id="sectionHeader">
				So, why was it that the European settlers were taking control of land that very obviously did not belong to them?</p>
				<p>Europeans had developed laws about land ownership, and they were expecting the same from the Aboriginals that they encountered. Supposedly, the European governing figures attempted to find leaders in the Aboriginal community to sign treaties on the behalf of the natives, but could not find an indigenous citizen with the authority to sign such documents. The Europeans weren't expecting this, and didn't have any official laws in place that were also agreed upon by the Aboriginals.</p>
				<br>
				<p>So, there were no agreements made between the two ethnic groups. Even if they could overcome the language barrier, there would be little concepts to agree upon:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The Indigenous did not ever own land, instead they were part of the land</li>
					<li>They did not share a common interest in the uses of the land, other than living on it</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The Europeans had interest in destroying the land by farming, where the Aboriginals had a spiritual connection to it, and did not exploit it</li>
						<li>Europeans would develop infrastructure, but the local natives would most likely be opposed</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Aboriginals would likely be unwilling to sacrifice their land that had been theirs for thousands of years, and the Europeans would most probably want excessive amounts</li>
				</ul>
				<p>It would be unlikely that the two races could live together peacefully. It was simply that there was too great of a contrast between the ways of life. The Europeans simply did not understand the concepts of Aboriginal culture. They failed to understand that the land held deep spiritual connection, just like the church would for a Christian. They did not realise the cultural traditions, such as dances or clothing, and deemed it as "uncivil".</p>
				<br>
				<p>And with that, the land was declared <strong>"Terra Nullius"</strong>. This was because there was no civilised establishment, the land lacked a governing force and there were no laws already in force. The British took it upon themselves to claim the land, because according to law, the land was empty and unclaimed because it didn't meet their requirements of possession. Because the Aboriginals were classed as uncivil, they were not regarded as equal people.</p>

It is titled "<a id="link" href="https://youtu.be/vOExa-04Y2k">Dispossesion and Government Control - Aboriginal History</a>" and shows interviews with indigenous about the encounters their predecessors had in colonial Australia</p>

				<br>
				<p>Although the Europeans made a legitimate attempt to make peace with the natives, they were vastly inconsiderate of local customs, and were not willing to accept a way other than their own. Their actions were in uniform with laws but were suited to the needs and wants of settlers. To create a more successful rapport, the colonisers would have had to adapt and compromise with the Aboriginals.</p>
				<br>
<!--S2-->		<div id="divider"></div>
				<br>
				<p id="sectionHeader">If Aboriginals were essentially disregarded, how were they treated in accordance to the law?</p>
				<p>Aboriginals were not bound to laws unless the issue in question involved a white man. In that case, the Aboriginal was handled under the law as a European would have been, but people were often biased towards the situation, being more lenient towards the white people. In many cases, if the indigenous party was victimised, there was no protection from the law for those people, so the legal system was unbalanced.</p>

				<p>Pemulwuy was a leading Aboriginal figure in the resistance to colonisation from the Europeans in and around Botany Bay, at the sight of the first settlements.</p>

				<p>He began his rebellion against the settlers when he murdered John McIntyre, who mistakenly trusted him. McIntyre held an important position in the colony - a gamekeeper (protector of a large piece of land). In retaliation, Governor Phillip decided that he would execute two natives and remove 4 others from the land, however this was not successful. It was attempted again, and an Aboriginal was killed.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Pemulwuy continued to show his disapproval of the settlement by joining forces with different Aboriginal tribes to raid Europeans. They would often kill livestock and destroy crops and on one occasion killed a convict.</p>
				<p>After leading an attack of over 100 indigenous on a settlers farm, Pemulwuy was badly injured. He escaped capture, and a few years later the government placed a reward for his capture, dead or alive. He was shot dead by a sailor: Henry Hacking. His resistance came to a murderous end in 1802.</p>
				<br>
				<p id="sectionHeader">As punishment, the Aboriginals were subject to consequences similar to the white people, but in other areas of law, ruling was not as fair.</p>
				<p>The Europeans brought with them their concept of individual land ownership, where a citizen is entitled to own a patch of land. Of course, the Aboriginals did not agree with this, but even if they did attempt to follow the white customs they wouldn't be allowed. They were not able to legally own land, so the land they were forcefully removed from was not able to be regained without fighting.</p>

				<p id="sectionHeader">Why was it that the Europeans were so careless toward the Aboriginals?</p>
				<p>Europeans believed their way was the only way for the most part. The 'primitive' customs of the Aboriginals was what the Europeans called uncivilised, and therefore treated the Aboriginals as savages. They made attempts to civilise some natives, and they successfully did so to an extent, but the Aboriginals remained focused on their own beliefs.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Additionally, the Europeans were greedy. They wanted to meet their standards, which was to take large amounts of resources and land that would usually have been used by the natives. What was done by the Aboriginals was of least concern to the settlers, they were very much about themselves.</p>
				<br>
<!--S4-->		<div id="divider"></div>
				<br>
				<p id="sectionHeader">Did the settlers understand the Aboriginals?</p>
				<p>The settlers would most probably have known that the Aboriginals had differing values, but it was hard for them to assimilate it. To this day, we can acknowledge that other people might have different beliefs and cultures to our own, but we still struggle to understand differing concepts.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The difference is, we can be accepting of other beliefs. Modern society believes in the concept of "To each their own". Harmonious living between people from diverse backgrounds requires acceptance, something the settlers of the 18th century didn't have.</p>

				<p id="sectionHeader">What could have been done in the colonial times to resolve or minimise the conflict?</p>
				<p><strong>Europeans could have...</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Used less resources</li>
						<li>Attempt to communicate with natives at greater lengths</li>
						<li>Be less possessive and more willing to share and compromise</li>
						<li>Have weaker retaliations</li>
						<li>Respect Aboriginal values</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<strong>Aboriginals could have...</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Reduced violent resistance</li>
						<li>Be more willing to share</li>
						<li>Compromised more effectively</li>
						<li>Attempt better communication</li>
					</ul>
