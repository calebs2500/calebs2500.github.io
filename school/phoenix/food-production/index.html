					Cocoa comes from the cacao plant, which grows in warm climates, generally close to the equator. It is grown across all the continents that intersect the equator (Asia, Africa & South America). 
					<br><br>
					The world’s largest exporter of cocoa is Côte d'Ivoire (official French name, translates to "Ivory Coast"), a nation in western Africa. With 1.65 million tons of cocoa exported in 2012, it exports nearly double the amount of the second largest producer, Indonesia.
					</div>
					<div id="content2" class="content">
					Many countries worldwide import cocoa, and even more consume it in some way. The Netherlands is the biggest importer of cocoa beans, but the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Belgium also import large quantities.
					</div>
					<div id="content3" class="content">
					A major social impact of the industry is the common illegal trafficking of children to work as slaves, which is quite inhumane. 
					<br><br>
					Economically, the industry generates income for the farmers and country, resulting in an above average GDP for the area. 
					<br><br>
					Environmental impacts are not too disastrous in the industry, however farmers have cleared protected habitat to make way for plantations, which impacts the local primate population, but not greatly.
					</div>
					<div id="content4" class="content">
						<ul>
							<li>Children are taken away from their families thinking that they can make money for their families, but many will never see their families again. This is very daunting and devastating for children, especially because they are powerless.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Some children have tried to flea, but if they are caught they face brutal punishment. Those who escape successfully either have to fend for themselves or receive help from a stranger.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>The work is physically draining on children, because of the tough labour required and long hours forced upon them.</li>
							<li>Children are not cared for well and are denied from education.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Farmers who "own" the children often employ physically violent punishments for slaves not meeting their expected standard.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div id="content5" class="content">
					As a result of the mistreatment, the children have a very low quality of life and become unhealthier than they might have already been. 
					<br><br>
					Chocolate companies come under fire for the mistreatment of the children, even though they may not be consciously endorsing the slavery. This could have an economic downturn on the companies, but this is unlikely.
					</div>
					<div id="content6" class="content">
					There are aid programs being run to prevent the use of child slaves, which are funded by chocolate companies themselves. Many companies vowed to confirm their cocoa supply was not sourced from an illegal slave farm, and an international organisation was formed to oversee the issue. However, it's difficult to police the issue as there is no good way to monitor what happens at the farms without investing hundreds of man hours that is simply not viable.
					<br><br>
					There are people living in the area, especially on the border of Mali and the Ivory Coast that intersect the human traffickers at the border, but this is not 100% effective as it is very simple to "slip past" the border, with easy to access back roads that have no surveillance at all.
					</div>
					<div id="content7" class="content">
					You can show your support for the campaigns to stop child labour in the cocoa production, because the more people that voice their opinion, the more prevalently known the issue becomes. 
					<br><br>
					To completely avoid products associated with child slavery, you could not purchase any chocolate or cocoa products because there is no way to confirm if they endorse the child slavery.
