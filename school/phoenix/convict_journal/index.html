				Today, I lost my job. Yesterday, I was one of the company’s best employees, and today an unemployed man, with no source of income. I would never have guessed that nineteen years of metal working would come to this. A redundancy met with nothing more than a “we don’t need you anymore,” not a thanks or anything courteous.
				<br><br>
				I really should have seen it coming; people had been dipping into unemployment for the last few years. Jobs were being replaced everywhere across the country. One machine could do a day’s work of fifteen men, the company didn’t need us around anymore, and we were a burden to their profit.
				<br><br>
				The money remaining would only last us a week, maybe two if we stretched it. Was there a good way to keep my boy and lady nourished? None came to mind.
				<br><br>

				Food is scarce; two meals a day. I could always be fairly safe with my antics when I went to Mrs Hendrick’s place though. Out the back, behind the shed she’d have a stale loaf of bread out on the ground for her chickens. I could take a half loaf unnoticed; she wouldn’t come back out to check anytime soon. But alas, she was running dry on funds too. The bread turned to oats, and then there was nothing. Other options are not plentiful, but we need something.
				<br><br>

				Risky business, but every day, without fail, Mr Montgomery the baker would head out for a half hour at 2 in the afternoon. He’d lock the door behind him and walk to the left of the store. I happen to know of a window he leaves open at the rear of the building, so I sneak in. The baker is mostly blind, but even then, you’d think he’d notice that a whole loaf was missing. It’s what keeps us going at this point.
				<br><br>
				<span id="date">June 11, 1801</span><br>
				Today was bad, the fright of my life you could say. I nicked into the bakery, as was my daily duty by now and walked into the front. A click; I froze. Montgomery’s shadow lingered between the bushes’ through the window. He stepped forward, and I ran for his back window. Time slowed, similarly to the time I was chased by a growly dog at age 9. Leaping through the window, I was sure that he’d saw me, but he didn’t give chase. 
				<br><br>
				Why would a man of such a strict routine be back so early? He’d forgotten something maybe. I have so many questions, but that isn’t one of importance.
				<br><br>
				<span id="date">June 14, 1801</span><br>
				I sit with iron around my ankles. They had come as we woke, and took me away. Pilfering a loaf of bread is my conviction. My fate undecided officially, but I know what is sealed for me. The dirty, diseased hulks are all overflowing by now; I doubt they’ll put me in there. I need to ready myself to say good bye and so long to the motherland, and my family.

				Life on board the Perseus is harsh. For most of the day, we are confined to our cells on the prison deck. Sunlight seeps through the cracks, but that’s about all we get with the exception of our “fresh air” and exercise breaks. For 10 minutes a day they take off our shackles and let us run loose, but really the air is not fresh, still polluted by the disease of the rotten, stinking ship. The only difference is really the lack of stench. 
				<br><br>
				<span id="date">August 29, 1801</span><br>
				Sleep really is hard to come by. The ship rocks with the tide, and my body doesn’t agree with it. My stomach churns of a night, not ideal when I’m trying to catch some rest. The hammock was also far from ideal, difficult to get comfortable in, especially when it was wet and mouldy. I tire easily, too. It’s a terrible concoction of disaster.
				<br><br>
				<span id="date">September 2, 1801</span><br>
				I consider myself lucky. Despite my terrible condition right now, I am honestly better off than many of my ship mates. People are dying and illness spreads uncontrollably. Scurvy, fever and dysentery make a triple threat of lethal diseases plaguing the other convicts and myself. I can only imagine how difficult it must be for a person already so weak and helpless to have such a crushing disease.
				<br><br>

				The rations are getting smaller as we run low on supplies. Starvation is really getting the better of me, not only in the rumblings of my stomach though. I’m finding it hard to do my exercises, lacking energy. I never thought I’d say it, but I actually cannot withhold my excitement to make it to the Southern Land. 
				<br><br>
				<span id="date">September 11, 1801</span><br>
				Today, a couple of the other convicts were escorted to the deck. It was bizarre really, it never happened. We whispered about what we thought was happening, but it wasn’t long before our questions were answered. “300,” boomed the captain. Then, the unmistakeable sound of 9 straps lashing flesh. So, the captain had brought out the cat for the rowdy men, time to shut up.
				<br><br>
				A weapon designed to inflict maximum pain on a person. Strands specifically designed to lacerate. A barbaric punishment. To think a man could even have the guts to stand behind another man and flick 9 sharp strands of leather on his flesh with all his might. Over and over. Until he bled. The victim could not even retort, more beating for each noise he made, and unable to move. It really did work though, a deterrent for many. The thought made me shudder.

				We were told we’d hit land tomorrow. Without lying, I’m relieved. I’ve actually managed to go this long without getting diseased, getting whipped, or even dying. An achievement in a sense, but the time had given me space to reminisce. The true extent dawned; I’d never see my home again. I’d never see my family again. Truly harsh. Just the boat trip was enough of a punishment.

				Sure enough, we landed in New South Wales today. It was actually a nice place. Beautiful greenery and a majestic coastline bordered our camp, and the brisk, but gentle autumn breeze was calming. It beat the ship by a long shot. All day we were pitching our own tents, it was actually enjoyable to stretch my legs.
				<br><br>
				<span id="date">May 7, 1802</span><br>
				Even though we had just arrived, there were jobs needing doing. We were each specified a job, generally based off our profession back home, but weirdly, they made me a farmer. It was tough work, but I didn’t really mind for now. I spent the day today preparing the land; tilling soil.
				<br><br>
				<span id="date">May 12, 1802</span><br>
				Some others weren’t so lucky with their forced occupation. I heard of men that hauled wagons of gravel back and forth, for fifteen, sixteen, or even more hours a day. Any slacking resulted in that brutal cat, clawing at the skin. I’d already heard the tales of men flogged 400 times, until they couldn’t stand, and still expected to work the next day.
				<br><br>
				<span id="date">May 15, 1802</span><br>
				Today wasn’t a good day. As I seeded the wheat, I couldn’t concentrate. All I could think of was my family back home. How were they faring? Were they still alive? It sickened me to know that maybe I had a better life than them here in Australia. I thought back to that day I was dismissed from my job with shame and sorrow. It was the start of all this.
